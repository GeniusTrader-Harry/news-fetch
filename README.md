> **Wake up to a curated FT + WSJ markets brief in Telegram every morning.** Subscriber-grade primary sources via paywall-bypass fetchers, theme-tagged stories with one-sentence interview hooks, and a daily view-forming question that forces you to take a position.

## Why this exists

Most "AI news digest" tools either (a) regurgitate Reddit/Twitter, or (b) summarise headlines you've already seen, badly. This routine flips it:

- **Subscriber-grade primary sources** — full FT + WSJ article bodies via [`curl_cffi`](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi) Chrome-131 TLS impersonation. Not headline scraping.
- **Explicit editorial rules** — sourcing priority FT > WSJ > Reuters; no claim without a primary source; cite-what-you-fetched, never invented links.
- **Theme tagging for cross-day continuity** — every story gets a `[⏣ Theme]` tag (e.g. `⏣ AI capex`, `⏣ Term premium`, `⏣ UK fiscal`). Same theme = same tag, every day. After a month you absorb the dominant narratives reflexively.
- **A view-forming question every day** — one controversial question forced by today's stories, designed to make you actually take a position.

It's designed for someone who reads the news for a *reason* — research, trading, monitoring a beat — not just ambient awareness. The opinionated bits are the value. Fork it, tune it for your beat.

## What lands in your Telegram every morning

*📈 Markets Briefing — Tuesday, 05 May 2026*

*🌍 Market in 60 seconds*
S&P 500 closed at a fresh record of 7,259 (+0.81%) and Nasdaq hit
25,326 (+1.03%) as AMD's blowout Q1 results and chip-sector optimism
drove tech higher; Brent crude pulled back 4% from Monday's $114 high...

*📊 Earnings today*
BMO: HSBC (miss — $9.4B vs $9.59B est), Lloyds (beat), StanChart (beat)
AMC: AMD (beat — rev $10.25B vs $9.85B est, +4.4% AH)

*💱 Macro & rates*

*1. [⏣ Energy security] Global oil reserves approaching 8-year low*
Global crude stockpiles fell nearly 200mn barrels (6.6mn b/d) in April...
_Why it matters:_ Jim Burkhard of S&P Global put it plainly — "the
tipping point" where stocks hit critical levels is weeks away. At 45
days of cover, the next supply disruption reprices energy violently.

[... continues for ~12 stories across Macro / Equities / M&A / a
deep-read pick / a view-forming question ...]

*🎯 Today's view-forming question*
If 30Y gilts hold above 5.75% through Thursday's local elections,
which UK bank's loan book is most exposed to MFS-style credit events?
Defend either side.

## How it works

**Sources are tiered**: FT (primary, full-body) · WSJ (peer, full-body) · Reuters (breaking-facts backstop) · CNBC + central banks (aggregator/event-only). See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for limits and source-specific notes.

## Install

**Time required**: 30–45 minutes (mostly waiting on BotFather and browser tabs — the actual scripted part is ~10 min).
**Difficulty**: comfortable with Terminal, a Cookie-Editor browser extension, and editing JSON.
**Prerequisites**: macOS · [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) 2.x · Python 3.9+ · a Telegram account · *(optional but encouraged)* an FT and/or WSJ subscription.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/GeniusTrader-Harry/news-digest.git ~/news-digest
cd ~/news-digest

# Install Python deps (curl_cffi is the paywall-bypass library)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install curl_cffi
```

Then in Claude Code, with the folder open, **invoke the bundled setup skill**:

```
/news-digest-setup
```

It walks you through every remaining step interactively — Telegram bot creation, cookie export, Claude Code permission allowlist, folder trust dialog, `pmset` daily-wake schedule, scheduled task registration, end-to-end test. **For a non-interactive walkthrough see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).**

## Customisation

The published prompt ships with an opinionated example: a markets brief with US-anchored geography, themes like *AI capex* / *Term premium* / *UK fiscal*, and a finance-flavoured view-forming question. **All of this is meant to be tuned for your beat.** See **[CUSTOMISATION.md](CUSTOMISATION.md)** for how to swap:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Audience framing | line 1 of [routine-prompt.md](routine-prompt.md) |
| Geography weighting (current default: US/UK/EU/Asia 50/25/15/10) | Quality bar block |
| Theme dictionary | Step 2 → Theme tags |
| Section sizes (Macro / Equities / M&A counts) | Output format |
| Sources (add/remove outlets) | Step 1 + Quality bar |
| View-forming question style | Output format |

## What's in this repo

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [routine-prompt.md](routine-prompt.md) | The prompt the scheduled task runs every day. Templated — replace `<USER_NAME>` and `<PROJECT_DIR>` during setup. |
| [send_telegram.sh](send_telegram.sh) | Reads `.env`, chunks brief into ≤3800-char messages, POSTs to Telegram Bot API. Falls back to plain-text if Markdown parsing fails. |
| [fetch_ft.py](fetch_ft.py) / [fetch_ft.sh](fetch_ft.sh) | FT article fetcher: `curl_cffi` Chrome-131 TLS impersonation + your session cookie → JSON-LD body extraction → clean markdown. |
| [fetch_wsj.py](fetch_wsj.py) / [fetch_wsj.sh](fetch_wsj.sh) | WSJ fetcher: same TLS approach + hybrid extraction (JSON-LD metadata + `<p data-type="paragraph">` regex with style-block stripping). |
| [skills/news-digest-setup/SKILL.md](skills/news-digest-setup/SKILL.md) | Interactive Claude Code skill that walks you through full setup. |
| [examples/sample-brief.md](examples/sample-brief.md) | A real morning brief — full text. |
| [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) | Non-interactive 14-step manual walkthrough. |
| [CUSTOMISATION.md](CUSTOMISATION.md) | How to tune the prompt for your beat. |

## Limitations and honest caveats

- **Mac-only as written**: relies on `pmset` for daily-wake. Linux/Windows users would adapt the schedule mechanism (cron or systemd timer).
- **Laptop-bound**: Claude Code scheduled tasks run on your machine. If your Mac is off at the fire time, the run is missed. Worth solving with Login Items + lid-closed-but-charging.
- **Cookie maintenance**: FT and WSJ session cookies expire every 2–4 weeks. The brief detects expiry (`⚠️ cookie may need refresh`) — re-export from Chrome takes ~30 seconds.
- **Quality varies with model effort**: targeted at Claude Code's high-effort mode. Lower-effort runs produce blander hooks.
- **Brand-new repo**: no community usage yet, no proven robustness across edge cases. Issues + PRs welcome.

## Contributing

Fork it, tune it, share it back. Areas where contributions land especially well:

- Linux / Windows wake-schedule equivalents (cron, systemd, Task Scheduler)
- Other paywalled outlets people have working fetchers for (Economist, Barron's, etc.)
- Theme dictionaries for non-finance beats (climate, biotech, geopolitics, etc.)

See [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) for the issue templates if you hit a bug or have a suggestion.
